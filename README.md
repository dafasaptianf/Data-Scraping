# Data-Scraping

In this repository, you'll find methods for scraping data from the website sofascore.com. The code was last tested around August to November 2024. It may require adjustments to the API and IDs for individual matches and players.

## Requirements

-  Google Chrome installed
-  Chromedriver that matches your Chrome version

## Dependencies
This project uses several Python libraries for web scraping, data processing, and visualization. Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the scripts::

### Main Libraries
- Selenium: Used to automate data retrieval from websites (web scraping).
- Webdriver Manager: Simplifies Chromedriver management and installation.
- Pandas: Used for processing and storing data in table formats.
- NumPy: Aids in numerical data manipulation.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used to create data visualizations like graphs and heatmaps.

## How to Install Dependencies
If not already installed, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

``` 
pip install selenium webdriver-manager pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

If the project uses a requirements.txt file, you can install all dependencies at once with:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
